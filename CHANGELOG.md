The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

However, prior to 0.3.0 we were not following Semantic Versioning, so we broke things.

## [Unreleased]

## 0.3.0 - 2018-06-20

This was the first "stable" release
Prior to that, were just me playing around with concepts.
It has started as a validation library and then we added the concepts such as
Refinement Types and having the type definitions in runtime to enable things
such as Coercion.

This also removed Coercion from this repository, focusing on the core library only.
